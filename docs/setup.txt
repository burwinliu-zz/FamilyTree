To run, some items are necessary:
    nodejs installed
    a mysql database set up
    all items in requirements_python.txt and all js packages in package.json installed (see requirements files)
    You must define (in the server/app module) a config.py with a few datapoints related to your database setup
        This includes SECRET_KEY and SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI (Search up where to find these, this is in relation to your mySQL setup

For the sake of development, if you are working on the flask end of things (Python) you may just need the requirements_python setup and the mySQL database implemented
                             if you are working on the react end of things (JS) you will need the whole affair set up as the JS depends on the REST api implemented through FLASK
